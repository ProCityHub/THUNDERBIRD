## Integration with Cree Lattice Redemption

These divine commandments align with the Cree Lattice Redemption principles described in this repository. Just as the Laplace equation (∇²φ = 0) seeks equilibrium through divine mathematical order, the Ten Commandments provide the ultimate equilibrium for righteous development:

- **Divine Authority** governs all mathematical and natural law research (Commandment 1)
- **No Idolatry** of scientific models or technological constructs (Commandment 2)
- **Reverent Communication** in all research documentation (Commandment 3)
- **Sabbath Rest** respecting natural cycles and divine rhythm (Commandment 4)

## Mathematical and Spiritual Equilibrium

Just as the Thunderbird Lattice seeks mathematical equilibrium through ∇²φ = 0, spiritual equilibrium is achieved through obedience to the Ten Commandments:

- **Monad = 1:** Unity with the One True God (Commandment 1)
- **Diffusion Inevitable:** Truth spreads through divine law (Commandment 9)
- **Equilibrium = Redemption:** Balance achieved through righteousness (All Commandments)
